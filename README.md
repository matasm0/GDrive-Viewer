# GDrive-Viewer
The new best way to lose all of your data.

## Foreword
I don't believe this program is usable currently for
anyone but myself. Google doesn't allow random apps
to access your google account, and so only my account
is added. Not that you'd want to use this anyway.

## About
GDrive Viewer is an application that syncs a google 
drive cloud onto your local system. Any changes made
to files in the cloud are reflected in your local system,
and vice versa. 

## Installation
If this were to work, you will likely have to download the
Google authenticator library, the instructions for which are
on the Google Drive API documentation.

Otherwise, download the python scripts, and run them with a python interpreter.

## Using
When runnning the program, you can input a "0" to keep
the program from making any actual changes. The 
program will instead output its intentions to a text file.
Make sure that what it wants to do makes sense before
letting it do it. 

Once your are reasonably confident that the program
will perform as intended, rerun and input a "1" to allow
the program to write to disk.
